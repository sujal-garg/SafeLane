### Description
 - Our solution mainly consists of a Flutter based mobile app. We wanted
   our solution to be a cross-platform application, that's why we picked flutter as our
   framework.
  
 - For the backend, we mostly relied on Firebase, as it was easier to
   integrate with the flutter app, without any hassle to manage & create
   instances of our server. 
 - For sign-up & authentication, we used Firebase auth. 
 - For storing the different types of data including user data, posts, etc. we chose Cloud         Firestore because of its robust
   features and ability to query & filter out documents with ease.
 - Map is built using Google Maps API and Direction API is enabled in the Google Maps for polyline formation.
 - Deeplink is used to mail the details of road obstructions to concerned authorities.
